**Question:**

Implement a React component that displays a square div with a dynamically changing background color. The initial background color should be red. Every time a button labeled "Click me" is clicked, the counter displayed below the square should increment by 3, and the background color of the square should change to a randomly generated RGB color. The color transition should be smooth. Ensure that the component efficiently updates the background color without unnecessary re-renders.
